A sample client chat application built in laravel based on Strophe.js and openfire. Currently this application allows you to register and login, I have used a sample bootstrap template no offense. Once you logged in the application allow you to send friend request to jabber client/registered user and notify them on new friend request arrival. If they accpet the request jabber client sends back the subscription packet so that whenever the user is online they can see each other online. 

The chat module is still under progess will get back to you soon.
